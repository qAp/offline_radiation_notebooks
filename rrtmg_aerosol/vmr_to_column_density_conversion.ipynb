    "# Converting volumn mixing ratio to column density\n",
    "\n",
    "In running RRTMG column model, if `IATM = 1` in the INPUT_RRTM, then molecule concentrations can be given in a variety of units listed in Table II in the instructions.  Choosing `IATM = 1` also means that RRTATM, a \"ray-tracing program\" originally from LBLRTM, will be used.  It is in this program that, if the user-specified atmosphere profile pressures and altitudes are not appropriately accurate, errors such as \n",
    "\n",
    "     BOUNDARIES ARE OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THE ATMOSPHERE\n",
    "     BOUNDARY =       2.85 ATMOSPHERE =      2.85\n",
    "     RESET BOUNDARY GT THAN ATMOSPHERE\n",
    "     BOUNDARIES OUTSIDE OF ATMOS\n",
    "     \n",
    "might be raised.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If IATM = 0, the molecule concentrations need to be as column densities, with units of `molecules/cm**2`.  It is these column densities that are input into the subroutine `setcoef_sw()`, which is the earliest common subroutine between the the global version and the column version of RRTMG.  In the global model, before `setcoef_sw` is called, another subroutine, `inatm_sw` is called.  In this subroutine, amongst other things, the input molecules densities in volumne mixing ratio are converted to column densities in `molecules/cm**2`.  `inatm_sw` is not included in the column model, which calls its own `readprof()` before `setcoef_sw()`.  `readprof()` simply reads whatever values are in INPUT_RRTM and pass them to `setcoef_sw()`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if we want to use `IATM = 0` and we only have molecule densities as mixing ratios to begin with, we need to use the appropriate part of `inatm_sw` to convert mixing ratios to column densities before writing them to INPUT_RRTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of compiling `inatm_sw()` with f2py3, the relevant expressions will be extracted and tranlated into Python, because `inatm_sw()` also does many other things and require other input variables, which, in turn, need to be looked for. "
