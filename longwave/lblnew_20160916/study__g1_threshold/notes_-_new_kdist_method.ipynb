The number of spectral points, $N_{\\nu}$, tends to be extremely large, so applying the radiative transfer computation to each one of them takes too much time in total.  The k-distribution method works by grouping the spectral points into $N_{g}$ intervals, where $N_{g} \\ll N_{\\nu}$.  By applying the radiative transfer computation only to these g-intervals, instead of individual spectral points, the total computation time is greatly reduced."

The absorption coefficient of a g-interval can be thought of as a kind of an average of the absorption coefficient at all the spectral points belonging to the g-interval.  Different ways of doing the averaging are tried, with the aim of getting radiative transfer results closest to the line-by-line results.  \n",

A spectral point at which the Planck function is small should be given a smaller weight in the averaging of the absorption coefficients, and vice versa.
