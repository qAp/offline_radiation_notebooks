    "# K-distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The main motivation behind the k-distribution method is that the line-by-line method is too time-consuming. The number of spectral points, $N_{\\nu}$, tends to be extremely large, so applying the radiative transfer computation to each one of them takes too much time in total.  The k-distribution method works by grouping the spectral points into $N_{g}$ intervals, where $N_{g} \\ll N_{\\nu}$.  By applying the radiative transfer computation only to these g-intervals, instead of individual spectral points, the total computation time is greatly reduced.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Absorption coefficient\n",
    "The radiative transfer calculation in the k-distribution method is similar to the line-by-line method, with $g$ being kind of analagous to $\\nu$.  But intead of being a function of spectral point $\\nu$, the absorption coefficient here is a function of g-interval $g$, denoted by $\\kappa(g, l)$.  The absorption coefficient of a g-interval can be thought of as a kind of an average of the absorption coefficient at all the spectral points belonging to the g-interval.  Different ways of doing the averaging are tried, with the aim of getting radiative transfer results closest to the line-by-line results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to average the absorption coefficient is perhaps the arithmetic mean:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is found that this average does not work well.  Very often $k(\\nu, l)$ in a g-interval ranges over several orders of magnitudes, and the largest coefficient values dominate in the arithmetic mean.  So, instead of only considering the arithmetic mean of $k(\\nu, l)$, we have also tried the arithmetic mean of the following terms involving $k(\\nu, l)$: \n",

    "log_{10} \\left[ k(\\nu, l) \\right]\n",

    "\n",
    "Another issue with the simple arithmetic mean above is that it does not take into account of the $\\nu$-dependence of the Planck function, $B(\\nu, l)$, which can also range over several orders of magnitude within a g-interval.  A spectral point at which the Planck function is small should be given a smaller weight in the averaging of the absorption coefficients, and vice versa.  So, to take this into account, we weigh $k(\\nu, l)$ with the Planck function $B(\\nu, l)$ in the averaging.  \n",
