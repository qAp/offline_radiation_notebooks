    "\n",
    "This section describes how `forref` and `selfref` are obtained.  Essentially, `forref` and `selfref` are pre-computed data of dimensions (temperature, g-point).  \n",
    "\n",
    "*rrtmg_sw_k_g.f90* contains the data for the absorption coefficients for foreign and self-continuum, named `forrefo` and `selfrefo`, respectively.  These have dimensions (temperature, g-point).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the temperature dimension are temperatures, starting from $245.6$ K, in increments of $7.2$ K. The number of temperature values varies, depending on the spectral band and whether it is self or foreign continuum; there are about 10 values for self and about 4 values for foreign.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the g-point dimension are the g-point indices: 1 for the first g-point, 2 for the second, and so on.  There are 16 g-points in all spectral bands.  Note that these g-points are what is referred to as the original g-points in the comments (hence the `o` at the end of `forrefo` and `selfrefo`).  Since there are 14 spectral bands, there are a total of 224 g-points ---- this original model is also referred to as the 224-g-point model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`forrefo` and `selfrefo` are defined in separate subroutines for different spectral bands in *rrtmg_sw_k_g.f90*.  For example, `subroutine sw_kgb16` contains `forrefo` and `selfrefo` data for spectral band 16, the first spectral band in the shortwave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being used in the global climate model, this 224-g-point data is first reduced to a simpler 112-g-point set.  This is done by grouping together several g-points in the 224-g-point model into single g-points.  Within the same group, each g-point is given a weight.  This weight, for each g-point in the 224-g-point model, is contained in `rwgt`, which has dimensions (g-point,),  where g-point is the g-point index for all 224 g-points, (1, 2, ..., 224).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the grouping is as follows.  In the original 224-point model, each spectral band has 16 g-points.  After grouping, each spectral band has fewer g-points but this number may vary from band to band (just that they add up to 112).  The number of g-points in each spectral band in the 112-g-point model is contained in `ngc`.  `ngc` has dimensions (spectral_band,), where spectral_band is the spectral band index (1, 2, ..., 14).  For example, `ngc(3)` is the number of g-points in spectral band 3 in the 112-g-point model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of g-points in the 224-g-point model that are grouped together to form each g-point in the 112-g-point model is contained in `ngn`.  `ngn` has dimensions (g-point,), where g-point is the g-point index in the 112-g-point model, so has length 112.  For example, `ngn(45)` is the number of g-points in the 224-g-point model that are grouped together to form the 45th g-point in the 112-g-point model.  The g-points that are grouped together are *adjacent* to each other.  So, for example, if `ngn(11) = 5`, then 5 adjacent g-points in the 224-g-point model are grouped together to form the 11th g-point in the 112-g-point model.\n",
    "\n",

    "The result of this reduction from 224 g-points to 112 g-points are `forref` and `selfref`.  These have dimensions (temperature, g-point).  The values along the temperature dimension are the same as for `forrefo` and `selfrefo`.  The values along the g-point dimension now correpond to the g-points in the 112-gpoint model.  \n",
    "\n",

The index for `rwgt` is `iprsm + 16` because its index starts from the first g-point in the *first* spectral band in the 224-g-point model rather than from the first g-point in the current spectral band.\n",
